ðŸŽ¬ Treehouse Demo Reel
This short reel includes clips from several of the video courses I created during my time at Treehouse. As both the instructor and course developer, I was responsible for everything from scripting and technical demos to recording voiceover and on-camera segments.

These examples reflect my focus on clarity, pacing, and learner-friendly explanationsâ€”along with a bit of personality to keep things engaging.

### Way Back When 

In 2014 my job was to affix barcodes to vials of saliva in a medical laboratory. I would enter patient information into a computer, print out a little barcode sticker and paste it to a vial, vial after vial, all day, every day, seemingly for eternity. 
 
It was not my life's ambition. I had a master's degree in Postsecondary Education, hard-earned as a first-generation college student. I had wanted to be GED or vocational instructor.

But it was the recession. After my nonprofit job ran out of funds to pay me, I endured a long series of fruitless job interviews and finally went to work as a seasonal employee at Target. I wore a red polo shirt and bounced from temp job to temp job until I ended up at the lab, where my raw talent for affixing bar codes to vials of spit was so unparalleled they offered me a permanent full-time position.  

### Time for a Change 

By 2014, I knew it was time for a HUGE change. 

I was browsing jobs on my state employment website one day when I saw an ad for Code Oregon, a program that offered free online coding courses through Treehouse.

I researched furiously. I learned about Treehouse, Codecademy, Code School, boot camps. Here was my chance at a living wage. I was sure it had to be a "too good to be true" situation, but I happened on that very same day (I swear!) to see a post on Facebook from a college friend who'd attended a boot camp and landed an excellent job. 

I decided I would do it too. I finished the entire front-end web development track on Treehouse, about 60 hours, grinding through the courses all night and stickering vials of saliva by day. I went to local meetups. I secured a grant to attend a local code school and studied five hours a day, five days a week for 16 weeks. I landed my first job at a small web and marketing startup just nine months after writing my first line of code.  

### And here I am 

Today I'm a senior front-end software engineer at an ed-tech company, and I work on education platforms that help make a college education affordable. 

As an engineer I'm a fierce advocate for the user experience, and as an educator I strive to make technology accessible, exciting and joyful to everyone.

### Way Back When 

In the early 2010s, my job was to affix barcodes to vials of saliva in a medical laboratory for close to minimum wage. I would enter patient information into a computer, print out a little barcode sticker and paste it to a vial, and then repeat, vial after vial, all day, every day. 
 
Obviously it wasn't my life's ambition. I had earned a master's degree in Postsecondary Education with the intention to be GED or vocational instructor, but there was a recession, yadda yadda, and that's when I discovered coding.

### Time for a Change 

One day I saw an ad for Code Oregon, a program offering free online coding courses through Treehouse. _Get a job as a web developer!_ it proclaimed. 

I'd always been into computers. As a TA in college I had taught classes on how to build professional portfolios with Dreamweaver and Front Page. In the glory days of Livejournal I'd spend hours fiddling with the HTML and CSS to customize my journal templates. But I had no idea it was possible to become a developer without being a 14-year-old Math prodigy. And a boy. 

I researched furiously. Here was my chance at a living wage doing something I loved. Front End Development would the perfect marriage of logic and creativity for me. I was sure this had to be a "too good to be true" situation, but serendipitously on that very same day (I swear!) I saw Facebook post from a college friend who'd gone to boot camp and landed an amazing job. 

I decided that's what I would do, too. I finished the entire front-end web development track on Treehouse, about 60 hours, grinding through the courses all night and stickering vials of saliva by day. I went to local meetups. I secured a grant to attend a local code school and studied five hours a day, five days a week for 16 weeks. I landed my first job at a small web and marketing startup just nine months after writing my first line of code.  

### And here I am 

A little over a year after I opened a Treehouse account, they hired me as a contractor to create an HTML and CSS course. A few months after that, they hired me as full time dev instructor.  

I did that for a few years, then spent nearly 3 years work as a senior front-end software engineer at an ed-tech company, where I worked on education platforms that help make a college education affordable. 

Today I'm a well-rounded developer with a healthy mix of traditional engineering team experience as well as dev education, community and project management and mentorship.  

I've recently gone back to creating learning content full time, making affordable, accessible coding courses for [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).
